# AI-Powered-Image-Captioning-System
This project generates captions for images using deep learning. It combines InceptionV3 for image feature extraction and an LSTM-based decoder for text generation.

<li>Feature Extraction</li>
<li>Uses InceptionV3 to extract key features from images</li>
<li>Reads captions from captions.txt</li>
<li>Tokenizes and converts them into sequences for training</li>
<li>Trains an LSTM-based model to generate captions based on extracted image features</li>
<li>Takes an image as input and generates a relevant caption using the trained model</li>
</ul>
